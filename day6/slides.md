-   The task you are asked to work on is a transcription task.
-   There will be a series of random characters (letters and numbers)
    that appear on your screen, which must be typed into the provided space.
-   The user must write 100 transcriptions in 60 seconds.
-   The program must only change to the next text when the Levenshtein-distance
    of the transcription and the original text is `< 10`
-   We pay $1 for every response.
